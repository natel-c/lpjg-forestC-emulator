## Objective
The project aims to develop an emulator for the Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS) to enable faster simulations of forest carbon pools and fluxes in LandSyMM. This emulation approach addresses the need for reduced computational expenses in large-scale, grid-based carbon modeling.

## Getting started

## 1. Download the Data

Retrieve the dataset from the Zenodo repository

## 2. Install Dependencies

To set up the required conda environments for this project, use the provided `.yml` files to create environments with the necessary dependencies.

#### Creating Conda Environments

1. **TensorFlow GPU + SHAP Environment**  
   This environment includes TensorFlow (with GPU support) and SHAP for training and interpreting machine learning models.

   ```bash
   conda env create -f tf-gpu-shap-env.yml
   conda activate tf-gpu-shap
   ```

2. **Geopandas Environment**  
   This environment includes GeoPandas and other geospatial libraries for map plotting and figure generation.

    ```bash
    conda env create -f geopandas-env.yml
    ```
## 3. Training the Emulators

Activate the conda environment and navigate to the code directory:

```bash
conda activate tf-gpu-shap
cd code
```

###Carbon Stocks

- **Neural Network Training**

To reproduce paper results, edit the following line in train_nn_cstocks.py:

```bash
Change the number of epochs to 1000
epochs = 1  # change this to 1000
```
Run the training script:

```bash
python train_nn_cstocks.py
```
- **Random Forest Training**
To reproduce paper results, edit the following line in train_rf_cstocks.py:

Run the training script:
```bash
python train_rf_cstocks.py
```

###Carbon Fluxes
- **Neural Network Training**
Similarly, edit train_nn_cfluxes.py to set epochs = 1000, then:

```bash
python train_nn_cfluxes.py
```
- **Random Forest Training**
```bash
python train_rf_cfluxes.py
```
##4. Prediction and Evaluation
After training, evaluate emulator performance:
```bash
python evaluate_cstocks_historical.py
python evaluate_cstocks_rcp.py
python make_eval_table_cstocks.py
python evaluate_cfluxes_historical.py
python evaluate_cfluxes_rcp.py
python make_eval_table_cfluxes.py

```
## Reproducing the Figures

If you're only interested in reproducing figures, follow these steps:

1. Download data and models from the Zenodo repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Use the scripts below for each figure:

- **Figure 1**:
```bash
conda activate geopandas-env
python fig1_gridcells.py 
```
- **Figures 2 & 4**:
```bash
conda activate tf-gpu-shap
python fig2_lineplot.py
python fig4_lineplot.py
```
- **Figure 3 & 5**
```bash
conda activate geopandas-env
python fig3_map.py
python fig5_map.py
```
- **Figures 6 & 7**
```bash
conda activate tf-gpu-shap
python shap_plot.py --task cstocks
python shap_plot.py --task cfluxes
```
